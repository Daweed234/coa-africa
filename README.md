First step you have to know if you have the following tools:

1. vscode (code editor) you can use other text editors but vscode is my favourite
2. live-server(local-server)
3. node(connection-point)
4. browser (web-client)
5. you have to also open this folder in vscode

so to run the first challenge which is an interactive photo gallery do the following:

1. open the project in vscode
2. go in interactive_photo_gallery directory
3. find html directory
4. there you find a file called index.html
5. run that file using live-server
6. then the code will be opened in a defalt browser

3. and then run this command in the terminal node ./arrayMap.js
4. then you get the output

and to run the Coding Challenge 2: String Transformation do the following

1. open the project in vscode
